Here is Team-Arbitrary's Group Project.



Project Website: https://teamarbitraryproject.000webhostapp.com/

Testing Website: https://arbitrary-tests.000webhostapp.com



Deployment Platform: 000WebHost


Platform Tools:

- File Manager: https://files.000webhost.com/
- Database Manager: https://databases.000webhost.com/



## Coding Conventions:

Abbreviations are not used in any naming to avoid forgetting, misunderstanding, and incomprehension

- Folder, File or Constant for descriptive or for configuration: ALL-CAPS naming + underscore separating "\_" 

  - Example:

  

- General Folder Name: upper CamelCase 

  - Example:

  

- Code File Name [.html, .css, .js, .php]: upper CamelCase

  - Example:

  

- Class Name, Function Name: upper CamelCase

  - Example:

  

- Variable Name, ID: lower camelCase

  - Example:

  

- Specific Resource File Name [.jpg, .png]: lower camelCase
  - Example:



In short, except for the parts that need to capture attention, use lower camelCase for things that represent specific instances, and use upper CamelCase for upper-level instances that contain these instances.



## Some Notes for Coding:

Folder naming uses upper CamelCase, to eliminate "-" or "_" to reduce the length of names, to maintain a similar style to other kinds of programming project file structures, and to differentiate from resource files that represent specific instances

Filenames are case-insensitive for files on the Mac and Windows default filesystems, but Linux is sensitive. This is just a reminder here.  ; )
